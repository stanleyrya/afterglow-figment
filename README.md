Description
==========

Our goal is to create a real-time long-exposure mirror. Long-exposure photography combines stationary elements with moving elements into one image. Stationary elements are clear while objects in motion look blurred or stretched. Normally this is achieved with a long-duration shutter speed, however in our implementation we will be using a camera, computer, and projector. The camera will pick up bright light which will be processed by the computer before being projected. After a short period of time, the light will fade back to blackness. We will use the dark surroundings to our advantage to only display bright lights such as phone screens, glow sticks, glow-in-the-dark blocks, and toy lightsabers.

All passer-byers will be able to interact with our “mirror” and work together to create pieces of art. Use of phones and New Year’s light toys will be encouraged, and we will also have devices for the public to use. These devices range from glow in the dark blocks that kids can build (and subsequently knock down) to toy lightsabers.

This project is relatively simple and will require little to no time for both setup and teardown. Besides the camera, computer, and projector which will require electricity, we will only require a white wall or screen.

###Participation  
This project is intensively interactive, because it begins as a blank screen and only becomes art by the actions of the public participants. They can draw on, play with, observe, and experiment with the virtual canvas. Because of the open nature of our project, anyone can walk up to the screen and make a contribution. This makes participation both easy and entertaining.


###Creativity  
We think our project will instantly delight participants, because they will be able to create a living work of art instantly and collaboratively. The “afterglow” effect allows other contributors to build off of previous ideas and work together. The fade effect will keep the canvas constantly evolving. We’ll also experiment with filters and colorizing effects to make the canvas a distinctive and unusual work of art.

###Visual Impact  
Our project focuses on capturing light and displaying it to a large audience. The projection will be out in the open for anyone to join in. It will be immediately visible from a distance due to the light and color. People passing by are encouraged to interact with the display with any light they choose, even their phone’s screen. Because the nature of this project is very open and encompassing, we envision people congregating around our space.

###Feasibility  
There are many public libraries that allow us to interpret and process live video. This will ensure a timely production schedule that will meet the required deadline. All required hardware is already owned with the exception of a screen or wall, which can be purchased at any time. None of the physical construction is difficult or problematic.

###Appropriateness  
This project reflects the open and collaborative nature of Figment. We feel like it will bring people together in a positive way, including all ages, cultures and demographics because it needs no explanation or instructions. The project is just visual fun.

We’ll make sure our projector and laptop are suitably covered for the weather conditions, and we think the project would actually behave in a really interesting way if it did snow or rain. The light glinting off the falling particles would create a beautiful addition to the canvas. 

The only really fragile part of the project is the central stand with the electronics. One of us will protect the stand from intoxicated individuals and small children.

Construction Plan
==========

To construct the project, we will first set up the screen, which would be roughly 8’ by 12’. Then we will place the projector, laptop, and camera on a stand, such that the projected image can fill the screen.  We will hook up the electricity to the projector and camera stand, being mindful of the power cords. Finally, we will put a box of props near the region that the camera can see.

When considering safety, reckless patrons that may cause trouble with the blocks and toy lightsabers are a concern. One of us will always be observing the participants to prevent dangerous behavior and promote safe use of the props. Anyone with photosensitive epilepsy is another concern as our project is primarily visual. We will have at least one coordinator near the computer ready to turn off our project in the event of an emergency. We don’t plan to have any flashing effects, however the users may create flashes through their actions.

Our leave no trace plan involves removing all electronic items and their stands to our vehicle (off-site) for transport. The wall will be dismantled and removed as well. Ideally breaking down our project will take minutes.

This project will be similar to “MMORPA ART: Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Art”. In this video four artists build off of each other’s ideas and work together to create multiple masterpieces.

It will also be similar to the OK Go music video for their song WTF, which utilized time-delay visual effects.


Budget
==========

We have two separate funding requests for our project. Either way, we will need access to electricity and the offered table and two chairs.

We would like to request $350 for a proper projection screen, projector, and camera equipment. We believe this will create a more engaging project, that will increase both the realm of possibilities on the canvas and the crowd’s attention.

|Expense|Cost|
|:-------|----:|
|Projector rental - http://www.atsrentals.com/item--Dell-4210X-XGA-Projector--1044.html | $100 |
|Screen rental | $150 |
|Camera rental - http://www.atsrentals.com/gopro-hero4-rental.html | $50 |
|Glow sticks, lightsabers, glow-in-the-dark blocks, other fun props | $50 |
|Total | $350 |

If that level of funding is not possible for our project, we would still like to run this project because we are passionate about the idea. We can probably borrow our own projector, use a basic webcam, and improvise a screen. Although it wouldn’t be as big or fancy as it would be with a budget, it would still be fun and interesting.
